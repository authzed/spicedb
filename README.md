SpiceDB is a [Zanzibar]-inspired database that stores, computes, and validates application permissions.

Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use a [client library] to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.

Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:
- [Expressive APIs] for checking permissions, listing access, and powering devtools
- An architecture faithful to the [Google Zanzibar] paper, including resistance to the [New Enemy Problem]
- An intuitive and expressive [schema language] complete with a [playground] dev environment
- A powerful graph engine that supports distributed, parallel evaluation
- Pluggable storage that supports [in-memory], [PostgreSQL], and [CockroachDB]
- Deep observability with [Prometheus metrics], structured logging, and [distributed tracing]

See [CONTRIBUTING.md] for instructions on how to contribute and perform common tasks like building the project and running tests.

## Why SpiceDB?

### Verifiable Correctness

The data used to calculate permissions have the most critical correctness requirements in the entirety a software system.
Despite that, developers continue to build their own ad-hoc solutions coupled to the internal code of each new project.
By developing a SpiceDB schema, you can iterate far more quickly and exhaustively test designs before altering any application code.
This becomes especially important as you introduce backwards-compatible changes to the schema and want to ensure that the system remains secure.

### Optimal Flexibility

The SpiceDB schema language is built on top of the concept of a graph of relationships between objects.
This ReBAC design is capable of efficiently supporting all popular access control models (such as [RBAC] and [ABAC]) and custom models that contain hybrid behavior.

Modern solutions to developing permission systems all have a similar goal: to decouple _policy_ from the application.
Using a dedicated database like SpiceDB not only accomplishes this, but takes this idea a step further by also decoupling the data that policies operate on.
SpiceDB is designed to share a single unified view of permissions across as many applications as your organization has.
This strategy has become an industry best-practice and is being used to great success at companies large ([Google], GitHub, [Airbnb]) and small ([Carta], [Authzed]).

## Getting Started

### Installing SpiceDB

SpiceDB is currently packaged by [Homebrew] for both macOS and Linux.
Individual releases and other formats are also available on the [releases page].

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[releases page]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases

```sh
brew install authzed/tap/spicedb
```

SpiceDB is also available as a container image:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/authzed/spicedb:latest
```

For production usage, we **highly** recommend using a tag that corresponds to the [latest release], rather than `latest`.

[latest release]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases

### Running SpiceDB locally

```sh
spicedb serve --grpc-preshared-key "somerandomkeyhere" --grpc-no-tls
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see next steps, including loading the schema

### Developing your own schema

- Follow the guide for [developing a schema]
- [Watch a video] of us modeling GitHub
- Read the schema language [design documentation]
- [Jump into the playground], load up some examples, and mess around
