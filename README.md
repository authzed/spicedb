SpiceDB is an open source, Google [Zanzibar]-inspired, database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions.

Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use any of the official or community maintained [client libraries] to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.

[client libraries]: https://github.com/authzed/awesome-spicedb

Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:

- Expressive [gRPC] and [HTTP] APIs for checking permissions, listing access, and powering devtools
- A distributed, parallel graph-engine faithful to the architecture described in [Google's Zanzibar paper]
- A flexible consistency model configurable [per-request] that includes resistance to the [New Enemy Problem]
- An expressive [schema language] with tools for [rapid prototyping], [integration testing], and [validating designs] in CI/CD pipelines
- Pluggable storage system supporting [memdb], [MySQL], [PostgreSQL], [CockroachDB], and [Cloud Spanner]
- Deep observability with [Prometheus metrics], structured logging, and [OpenTelemetry tracing]

## Why SpiceDB?

### Verifiable Correctness

The data used to calculate permissions have the most critical correctness requirements in the entirety a software system.
Despite that, developers continue to build their own ad-hoc solutions coupled to the internal code of each new project.
By developing a SpiceDB schema, you can iterate far more quickly and exhaustively test designs before altering any application code.
This becomes especially important as you introduce backwards-compatible changes to the schema and want to ensure that the system remains secure.

### Optimal Flexibility

The SpiceDB schema language is built on top of the concept of a graph of relationships between objects.
This ReBAC design is capable of efficiently supporting all popular access control models (such as [RBAC] and [ABAC]) and custom models that contain hybrid behavior.

Modern solutions to developing permission systems all have a similar goal: to decouple _policy_ from the application.
Using a dedicated database like SpiceDB not only accomplishes this, but takes this idea a step further by also decoupling the data that policies operate on.
SpiceDB is designed to share a single unified view of permissions across as many applications as your organization has.
This has strategy has become an industry best-practice and is being used to great success at companies large ([Google], GitHub, [Airbnb]) and small ([Carta], [Authzed]).
