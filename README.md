SpiceDB is a [Zanzibar]-inspired open source database system for managing security-critical application permissions.

Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use a [client library] to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.

Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:

- Expressive [gRPC] and [HTTP] APIs for checking permissions, listing access, and powering devtools
- An architecture faithful to [Google's Zanzibar paper], including resistance to the [New Enemy Problem]
- An intuitive and expressive [schema language] complete with a [playground] dev environment
- A powerful graph engine that supports distributed, parallel evaluation
- Pluggable storage that supports [in-memory], [PostgreSQL], [CockroachDB] and [Cloud Spanner] (beta)
- Deep observability with [Prometheus metrics], structured logging, and [distributed tracing]

See [CONTRIBUTING.md] for instructions on how to contribute and perform common tasks like building the project and running tests.

## Why SpiceDB?

### Verifiable Correctness

The data used to calculate permissions have the most critical correctness requirements in the entirety a software system.
Despite that, developers continue to build their own ad-hoc solutions coupled to the internal code of each new project.
By developing a SpiceDB schema, you can iterate far more quickly and exhaustively test designs before altering any application code.
This becomes especially important as you introduce backwards-compatible changes to the schema and want to ensure that the system remains secure.

### Optimal Flexibility

The SpiceDB schema language is built on top of the concept of a graph of relationships between objects.
This ReBAC design is capable of efficiently supporting all popular access control models (such as [RBAC] and [ABAC]) and custom models that contain hybrid behavior.

Modern solutions to developing permission systems all have a similar goal: to decouple _policy_ from the application.
Using a dedicated database like SpiceDB not only accomplishes this, but takes this idea a step further by also decoupling the data that policies operate on.
SpiceDB is designed to share a single unified view of permissions across as many applications as your organization has.
This has strategy has become an industry best-practice and is being used to great success at companies large ([Google], GitHub, [Airbnb]) and small ([Carta], [Authzed]).

## Getting Started

### Installing SpiceDB

SpiceDB is currently packaged by [Homebrew] for both macOS and Linux.
Individual releases and other formats are also available on the [releases page].

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[releases page]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases

```sh
brew install authzed/tap/spicedb
```

SpiceDB is also available as a container image:

```sh
docker run -p 50051:50051 -p 8080:8080 authzed/spicedb:latest serve --grpc-preshared-key 'somerandomkeyhere'
```

For production usage, we **highly** recommend using a tag that corresponds to the [latest release], rather than `latest`.

[latest release]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases

### Running SpiceDB locally

```sh
spicedb serve --grpc-preshared-key "somerandomkeyhere"
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see next steps, including loading the schema

### Running SpiceDB for testing

```sh
spicedb serve-testing
```

This command runs SpiceDB such that each [Bearer Token] provided by the client is allocated its own isolated, ephemeral datastore.
By using unique tokens in each of your application's integration tests, they can be executed in parallel safely against a single instance of SpiceDB.

A [SpiceDB GitHub action] is also available to run SpiceDB as part of your integration test workflows.

[Bearer Token]: https://docs.authzed.com/reference/api#authentication
[SpiceDB GitHub action]: https://github.com/authzed/action-spicedb

### Configuring SpiceDB

In addition to CLI flags, SpiceDB also supports configuration via environment variables.
You can replace any command's argument with an environment variable by converting dashes into underscores and prefixing with `SPICEDB_` (e.g. `--log-level` becomes `SPICEDB_LOG_LEVEL`).

```sh
SPICEDB_GRPC_PRESHARED_KEY=somerandomkeyhere spicedb serve
```

### Developing your own schema
