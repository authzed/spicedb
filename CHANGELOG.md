### Security
- A fix for a [low-severity GHSA](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-vhvq-fv9f-wh4q) in [#2878](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2878)

## [1.49.0] - 2026-02-03
### Added
- Support for `self` keyword added to permissions.
  Previously, if you wanted to represent something like "a user should be able to view themselves," this required adding a relation to the schema and then writing a relation from the user to itself. We've added support for a `self` keyword in permissions that represents this directly, which reduces storage requirements, removes the need for a trip to the database, and removes a relationship that needs to be synced. For more information, see [the Docs](https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/concepts/schema#the-self-keyword) and the [PR](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/2785)
- Experimental Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper.

  In [#2806](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2806), we added a new experimental command to SpiceDB that serves a [Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers): `spicedb postgres-fdw [flags]`.
  If you configure your Postgres instance accordingly, it can speak to SpiceDB through the FDW as a proxy, allowing you to write queries like:

  ```sql
  -- Check if user:alice has permission to view document:readme
  SELECT has_permission
  FROM permissions
  WHERE resource_type = 'document'
    AND resource_id = 'readme'
    AND permission = 'view'
    AND subject_type = 'user'
    AND subject_id = 'alice';
  ```

  You can now express checks and lookups as `SELECT`s and `JOIN`s in your main application code, and you can read, write, and delete relationships using Postgres as the client.
  For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/tree/main/internal/fdw) in the repo.

  NOTE:
  * This feature is experimental. We'd welcome you trying it out and providing feedback, but it will likely change before its final GA'd form.
  * This feature DOES NOT solve the [Dual-Write Problem](https://authzed.com/blog/the-dual-write-problem). You *can* make updates in the context of a Postgres transaction, but Postgres's FDW protocol doesn't support a two-phase commit semantic, which means there are still failure modes where a transactional write will land in SpiceDB but not Postgres or vice-versa.
- Query Planner

  This release includes the first experimental handle on our new [Query Planner](https://authzed.com/blog/introducing-spicedb-query-planner). If you run SpiceDB with the new `--experimental-query-plan` flag, SpiceDB will use the query planner to resolve queries.
  This is mostly provided for the curious; there's still work to do on statistics sources and optimizations before we expect that it will provide performance benefits across most workloads.
  We don't yet recommend turning on this flag in your system outside of experiments in your local or development environments. We'll continue work and let you know when it's ready for production.

  #### Changed
- A fix for cockroach's connection pooler where the pooler won't report itself as ready until all connections are ready to be used: [#2766](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2766)
- A fix for a segfault when providing datastore bootstrap files with caveats in them: [#2784](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2784)
- Touching an existing relationship and providing an empty expiration field will now clear an existing expiration value in CRDB and MySQL: [#2796](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2796)
- A fix for lexing Unicode characters in string literals in schemas: [#2836](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2836)
- We've deprecated datastore hedging, as it didn't provide performance gains and led to a less stable system: [#2819](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2819)
- There's a new `--datastore-watch-change-buffer-maximum-size` flag for the Watch API that determines how many changes SpiceDB will buffer in memory before it emits an error. This protects against OOMkills when the backing datastore fails to produce a checkpoint: [#2859](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/2859)

## [1.48.0] - 2025-12-09

- serialization errors are not well handled in the Postgres datastore: - they tend to be logged by the `pgx` driver with potentially very   large SQL statements - they are not retried, nor there is a backoff. There are also other   types of errors that are not being retried, like `conn closed`   (which pgx considers safe to retry) - they return to the client as unknown instead of the recommended   aborted gRPC code - no information is logged on retries in `debug` level - logs can get extremely verbose due to large SQL and args
