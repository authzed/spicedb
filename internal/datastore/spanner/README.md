# Spanner Datastore

This datastore implementation allows you to use a [Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) database as the backing durable storage for SpiceDB.

## Usage Benefits

The Spanner datastore, like the CockroachDB datastore, can be used in highly scalable and multi-region installations.
